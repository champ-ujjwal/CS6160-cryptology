since it is a brute force attack, so take longer time (approx 7 min running time) to find the key,
so i add print statement for every iteration.like : "11200 iteration gets failed. Trying the next possible key."

To save your time i am writing the final answer
key : 8E6330
secret plain text: mediumaquaamarine
